1. The assignment mentions there is an efficiency issue with the way we are dissecting the candidate
DNA strand into substrings. There is another efficiency issue with this implementation,
having to do with redundant calculations. What is that issue and describe how we may resolve it.

I feel that the issue is having the charNumericValue method, I made the method but didn't really use it. Instead I just
implemented the base 4 numeric system in my string hash method. It checks for the value and hashes it accordingly. A lot of time
and memory would be wasted to have to call the Numeric Value method on every single char in a string before you can even hash it.

2. What is the purpose of the “Rolling Hash”, in the Rabin-Karp algorithm?

The purpose of rolling hash is to help automate the process of hashing subsequent substrings one after another. Like if you were to hash
the word "everything" in 2 char parts, you'd hash ev, ve, er, ry, etc.. There is a but of repetion and it can save time to use your previous
hash to help hash the next word.

3. Create six of your own test case DNA master and candidate strands, some valid, some invalid.
What were your test cases and their results?
