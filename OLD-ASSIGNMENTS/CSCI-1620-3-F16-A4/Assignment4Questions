1. What advantages do you gain from using an ArrayList for inputTasks rather than an array?

I would say the main advantage to me is the fact you do not need to know the length of the array ahead of time and you can simply add on what you need.
Most of the time in our programs we ask users for input over and over until their needs of the program are met.
There is often no way of knowing how many times the user will iterate through before stopping. 

2. Why can we not use an ArrayList for outputTasks?

In output tasks we need to have a static final length that cannot be added to once it has hit it's capacity.
This is to ensure the user does not over schedule themselves. ArrayLists may give you a bit more flexibility, but a standard structured array
is the most like someone's actual schedule/planner. It had a specific purpose of existing to just hold sorted information in certain timeslots.

3. Create six of your own scheduling test cases. What were your test cases and their results?
