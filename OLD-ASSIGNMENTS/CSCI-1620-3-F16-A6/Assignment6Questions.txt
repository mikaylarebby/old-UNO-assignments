1. What is beneficial about our input crime data being in a CSV file?
CSV files keep their structure and are easy to be read. CSV files are also pretty small in size as well. 

2. What benefit do we get in storing the crime statistics in a Serialized file? (This is not asking the benefit of simply storing the file, but specifically as a Serialized file.)
The advantage of using a serialized file is that the original binary representation of the values are stored.
This makes accessing and handling the file simpler and faster. Overall a more efficient option. 

3. Describe an existing or potential collection of data that could be similarly processed in your own field of study.
Rather than crime data, I could store and use project data. I work for an advertising agency, doing back-end web development
work. Because of the nature of the company, I often am working on dozens of sites at once. It would be nice to type in a clients
name and recieve information like "number of current active projects", "task with the nearest deadline", and "total number of tasks remaining".
All of this information could be easily stored in a csv file, and from my terminal, I could quickly check on all of my projects across all clients.
